                                        In the years before I became old enough to carry a rifle,
                                        I helped with the cannon crews of various guns. 
                                        I first served with the crew of a PaK 40 75mm anti-tank gun, 
                                        destroyed a Sherman tank at my very first re-enactment. 
                                        At first I simply helped carry shells, but years later I got the chance to be the loader.

                                        On many occasions I also served on the crew of a 
                                        75mm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz, or "light infantry gun."
                                        I have both loaded and fired the gun.

                                        The last type of towed gun I have served on so far is
                                        the 37mm PaK 36 anti-tank gun. I have also both loaded
                                        and fired this infamously ineffective (but still fun) weapon.

                                    The Hetzer tank destroyer is a very special vehicle to me.
                                    My father, grandfather, and uncle all served together on 
                                    a Hetzer in St. Louis for many years back in the day. Now,
                                    I have had the chance to serve in a Hetzer as well, as the 
                                    loader and gunner (simultaneously). My father has also since
                                    served as the commander of the vehicle many times now.

                                    Most recently, I have had the incredible privelege 
                                    to serve as the gunner of a newly restored Marder III H
                                    tank destroyer onwed by Bob Graebe in the 1st SS, and once again,
                                    my father serves as the commander. I'm looking very forward to
                                    future events in which I can serve on this wonderful vehicle.

                                    I recently got the chance to learn
                                    how to drive an Sdkfz 250 armored half-track. Just
                                    another thing to add to the list, and another skill
                                    I hope to be able to expand on some time.

                                    With the SS, I also once was given the opportunity to
                                    operate the .50 cal blank-adapted 37mm gun on one of their half-tracks.
                                    I had one of the most awesome battle experiences of my career
                                    pumping out shot after shot into the enemy, blowing away a multitude of
                                    allied light-skinned vehicles in front of me. It was incredible.
